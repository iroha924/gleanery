<!--
For maintainers. Claude Code does not read AGENTS.md when CLAUDE.md exists, and Codex does not read CLAUDE.md.
Rules copied to both are tied by the invariant at the end of the line. When you change one, fix the line with the same name in AGENTS.md too (verify:ai compares the sets of names).

# gleanery

## command

```bash
mise trust && mise install  # trust mise.toml and install Node, Bun, and actionlint at its versions
bun run setup             # install dependencies and Lefthook from the pinned lockfile
bun run verify            # lint, types, AI config, boundaries, bundle, tests, SQL reach, CLI child processes. pre-push and CI run the same
bun run verify:ai         # static checks of CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, Skills, and Agents
bun run bundle            # build the MCP, CLI, and capture artifacts
bun run cli -- dashboard  # the terminal screen. It needs a TTY, so run it only in the foreground
```

Start troubleshooting with `gleanery doctor`.

## Runtime boundaries

- `db/schema.sql` is the only source of truth for the DB. Do not add an ORM schema as a second source <!-- invariant: schema-single-source -->
- MCP and the terminal screen use the reader connection, ingestion and trace use ingest, capture uses capture, and `gleanery db *` uses owner. <!-- invariant: connection-roles -->
  Write connections live only in `server/src/db-write.ts` (`bun run architecture` checks it)
- Interfaces that read untrusted text (PR and issue bodies, recorded conversations) get no write access <!-- invariant: untrusted-no-write -->
- No server that listens <!-- invariant: no-listen -->
- No HTML or Markdown progress files. The DB is the source of truth for records <!-- invariant: no-progress-files -->

## When changing things

- Check the CLI and dashboard separately from MCP. One working does not mean the other works <!-- invariant: exits-separate -->
- When you change a value, category, or decision, find every reference with `rg` and fix the paired interface too. Add pairs you can list to a check <!-- invariant: rg-pairs -->
- Connect a new ingestion source to `gleanery harvest` too <!-- invariant: harvest -->
- A change that goes into the package bumps npm and the 3 plugin manifests to the same version, in the same branch (PR) <!-- invariant: version-sync -->
- Validate external input at the system boundary. Do not write credentials to tracked files, command arguments, or logs <!-- invariant: boundary-validation -->
- What we ship runs on Windows too. Do not depend on a POSIX shell, `0600`, a fixed `/tmp`, or execFile of `.cmd` <!-- invariant: windows -->
- Write strings and comments in new or changed code, and commit messages, in English. Translate existing Japanese text into English stage by stage, and do not translate records users saved (`bun run english` checks the English-only files) <!-- invariant: english-code -->

## Skills by task

Read to the end before implementing.

- Terminal screen and CLI output: `tui`
- DB schema, connection roles, full-text search index, ingestion: `knowledge-schema`
- MCP, CLI, capture hooks, plugin distribution: `plugin-release`
- Shipped review aspects: `plugin-agent-authoring`
- Creating Skills, Agents, and rules: `docs-author`

## Branches and PRs

Only changes that alter none of runtime behavior, data, auth, secrets, dependencies, build, CI, or the package, and that one commit's revert undoes, go straight to main.
Everything else, and any change whose impact you cannot state right away, goes through a PR.

## Before implementing

For a change in behavior, work out the plan with Codex using the `grill-codex` Skill before implementing, and get the owner's Go on the plan in `.claude/plans/`.
The plan records the implementation plan as agreed; it is not a progress file (do not append progress).

## Review

Hand it over only after `bun run verify` passes.

- `review-shipping`: before a commit that changes the package, versions, bundle inputs, or check scripts
- `review-ui`: before a commit that changes `server/src/tui/` or `server/src/palette.ts`
- Codex: before merging each PR. Ask by following the `codex-review` Skill
- GitHub's Codex (ChatGPT connector) reviews a PR automatically when it is created. Claude owns watching it and deciding on re-reviews; the owner only looks at finished PRs.
  The summary comment's table (Codex Review Summary) is the source of truth: when the head commit's Code Review is Completed, it is done (👀 in the PR body means running,
  👍 means everything finished with no findings). Findings are unresolved review threads; decide whether to fix or decline each, then resolve it. After a fix, confirm the push reached
  the remote, then comment `@codex review`. Stop when findings narrow to edge cases, and leave the rest in an issue for declined findings.
  Ask the owner for the final call only when the head's Code Review is Completed, there are 0 unresolved threads, and CI has fully passed

## Text that goes out

PRs follow `.github/pull_request_template.md` and issues follow `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`; delete sections you cannot fill. <!-- invariant: external-text -->
The body is ingested into the DB as is and quoted as something said, so do not write facts you have not checked.
