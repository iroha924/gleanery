// Counts whether the SQL call sites in server/src ran against a real SQLite database in tests.
//
// **Type checks and unit tests let SQL that never runs pass.** Tests really run SQL against SQLite in a temp directory,
// so a call site that ran was accepted by SQLite, including syntax, constraints, and the authorizer. This checks only
// whether each site ran, and lists the ones that did not as file:line.
//
// Reach is counted with V8 coverage (scripts/lib/coverage.mjs, the same tool as the child process lane).
