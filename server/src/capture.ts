// Conversation recording. Called from hooks, it keeps your messages, the AI's last response, and touched files.
//
// **Recording hooks only write to a local queue.** A process detached by Stop sends the batch over the network.
// While the database is unreachable the records stay queued and are resent idempotently next time (ids are derived from the input).
//
// **Prompts you did not type are never recorded as your messages.** In a prior case, prompts meant for another agent
// made up 97.2% of the database as "user messages". There are five checks, none of them guesses.
//   - turns inside a subagent carry agent_id in the hook input
//   - children started by Claude Code (claude -p or codex exec run from Bash) inherit GLEANERY_PARENT_SESSION, which the parent's
//     SessionStart wrote to CLAUDE_ENV_FILE. If it differs from its own session id, it is a child
//     (to keep a launch from being recorded, set a value that matches no session. The value is that session's id so that, if this
//     variable ever reaches the hook's own environment, it matches your own session id and recording does not stop)
//   - another Codex started from a Codex shell inherits the parent's CODEX_THREAD_ID. If it differs from the hook input's session id, it is a child
//   - headless runs that inherit no marker (claude -p from launchd or Codex) have CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT set to sdk-cli in the
//     hook's environment (measured in 2.1.269; undocumented). Sessions people type in are cli
//   - even within your session, background task completion and stop notices, and messages from channels, subagents, teammates,
//     or other sessions arrive at UserPromptSubmit (notices measured in 2.1.269). They are dropped by fixed shapes (INJECTED)
